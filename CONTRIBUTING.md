# How to contribute

Instruction steps for contributors and team members working on the project.

# Issues

An example issues tab with issues as goals.

Project goals and progress points will be split into separate issues. Team members will be able to self-assign or request assignment for each issue they wish to work on. Team members are encouraged to select issues that will give them a moderate challenge.

Issues should also be created for any bugs discovered in the project. (Very minor fixes and typos do not require an issue and can be corrected directly in a pull request with a detailed description.)

# Editing code and submitting a pull request

After selecting your first issue use the following process to make your changes.

## Forking, cloning, editing, pushing. 

1. Create a fork of the repo at https://github.com/Super-Bug-Tracker-Team/super-bug-tracker

1. A fork will be created to your personal GitHub account. Clone this fork on your local machine.

1. Create and checkout a branch for the Issue you are working on.

    `git checkout -b a-descriptive-branch-name`

1. Make any changes and save your work then make a commit

    `git status` see what has changed

    `git add .` stage your files

    `git commit -m "fixed a thingy"` perform the commit

1. Push the changes to GitHub

    `git push -u origin a-descriptive-branch-name` pushes to the remote branch

1. Now you can go back to GitHub.com to create a pull request.

## Pull requests

1. Visit your fork on GitHub and a new button should appear allowing you to create the pull request

## Merging pull requests

When there are open pull requests team members have the ability to merge them back into the repo. Try to get other team members to review and merge your code for you. They will be able to catch things you might have missed or make further requests or suggestions. The steps to merge code are below.

1. In the pull requests tab click on the pull request you want to merge and you will be brought to this screen.

1. Do not automatically merge requests. You can click on the various tabs at the top to see the commit messages and merge checks. The files changed tab will quickly show you everything that is changed line by line.

## Syncing your fork

Try keep your fork up to date after any pull requests are merged by clicking on "Sync fork" on your forked repository. This will help avoid merge conflicts the next time you submit a pull request.
